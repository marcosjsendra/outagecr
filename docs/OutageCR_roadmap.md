# OutageCR Development Roadmap

This document provides a detailed development roadmap for the Â¿Hay Luz? (OutageCR) platform, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD). It breaks down the project into phases, key milestones, tasks, and dependencies. This roadmap will be revisited and updated regularly to reflect progress and any changes in scope or priorities.

**Project Vision**: To create a public, user-friendly platform designed to empower Costa Ricans to check and report electricity, water, and internet outages in real time. The platform leverages crowdsourced data to provide accurate, up-to-date information through an intuitive map-based or list-based interface, optimized for mobile use and accessibility.

**Overall Timeline (Based on Refined PRD)**:

* **Phase 1: MVP**: Weeks 1-6 (6 weeks total)
* **Phase 2: Enhancement**: Weeks 7-12 (6 weeks total)  
* **Phase 3: Monetization & Advanced Features**: Months 7-12

**Assumptions**:

* Decisions from `human_requirements_OutageCR.md` are provided promptly.
* **Team**: Marcos Sendra (UI/UX Designer, Frontend Developer) and Cline with GLM-4.6 (Backend, Development tasks).
* **Budget**: No initial budget allocation required; development will be handled in-house.
* **Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built with Vite. Project name: `hayluz-outagecr`.
    *   **Hosting**: Sevalla.
    *   **Backend**: Supabase (API, Authentication, Database).
* **Map Provider**: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.
* **Initial Focus**: The MVP will launch with a focus on the Guanacaste province only.
* **Review Process**: CodeRabbit will be used for code reviews.
* **Testing & Deployment**: UAT will be performed by Marcos Sendra. Deployment will be a direct production rollout.
