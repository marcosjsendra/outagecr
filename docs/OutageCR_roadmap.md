# OutageCR Development Roadmap

This document provides a detailed development roadmap for the Â¿Hay Luz? (OutageCR) platform, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD). It breaks down the project into phases, key milestones, tasks, and dependencies. This roadmap will be revisited and updated regularly to reflect progress and any changes in scope or priorities.

**Project Vision**: To create a public, user-friendly platform for Costa Ricans to check and report electricity and water outages in real-time, using crowdsourced data.

**Overall Timeline (Based on PRD)**:

* **Phase 1: MVP**: 0-3 months
* **Phase 2: Enhancement**: 4-6 months
* **Phase 3: Monetization**: 7-12 months

**Assumptions**:

* Decisions from `human_requirements_OutageCR.md` are provided promptly.
* Budget of $10,000 for the first 6 months is secured.
* Development team (Frontend, Backend, UI/UX) is available.
* **Tech Stack**: Frontend will be a static site hosted on Servall. Backend API, Authentication, and Database will be managed by Supabase.
