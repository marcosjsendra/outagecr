# OutageCR API & Monetization Strategy

## üß© API Concept Overview

If OutageCR scales and gathers a consistent user base and dataset
(reports of water, power, and internet outages by region), you can
**open part of the data through a public API**.

### Types of Data You Could Expose

1.  **Real-time Outage Reports**
    -   Endpoint: `/api/outages/live`
    -   Returns current active outages by type, region, or provider.
2.  **Historical Outage Data**
    -   Endpoint: `/api/outages/history`
    -   Useful for analytics, reliability tracking, and research.
3.  **Statistics & Insights**
    -   Outage frequency, average duration, and impact level.
    -   Could power external dashboards or academic studies.
4.  **Geospatial Data**
    -   Return outages by province, canton, or district boundaries.
    -   Integrate easily with GIS systems (via GeoJSON output).
5.  **Provider Reliability Metrics**
    -   Aggregate metrics by service provider (e.g., ICE, AyA, Claro,
        etc.).
    -   Helps companies or journalists benchmark reliability.

## üí∞ Monetization Models

### 1. Freemium / Tiered API Access

-   **Free Tier** ‚Üí basic access, limited queries per day (e.g.,
    100/day).\
-   **Pro Tier (\$9--\$25/month)** ‚Üí more requests, real-time data.\
-   **Enterprise Tier (\$99+/month)** ‚Üí analytics, priority access,
    webhooks.

### 2. B2B Integrations

Offer **custom API or dashboards** for: - News outlets showing live
outage maps. - Utility companies monitoring customer reports. - NGOs or
research groups analyzing infrastructure issues.

### 3. Advertising / Sponsorship

Partner with **local utility providers, tech, or insurance brands** for
map sponsorships ("Sponsored by XYZ").

### 4. Data Reports

-   Monthly/quarterly reports on reliability trends (PDFs or
    dashboards).
-   Sell or license to:
    -   Government agencies.
    -   Research centers.
    -   Environmental orgs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåé Why It's Valuable

-   Costa Rica has decentralized utility services and often poor
    communication on outages.
-   Public, user-driven data fills a real gap.
-   Journalists, academics, and businesses would *love reliable local
    outage data*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack Considerations

-   Use **Supabase functions** to serve REST API endpoints.
-   Optionally expose **read-only routes** for public access.
-   Cache data with **Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers** for speed.
-   Add **API keys + rate limiting** for premium access.
