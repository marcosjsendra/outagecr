# Overview  
Â¿Hay Luz? (OutageCR) is a public, user-friendly platform designed to empower Costa Ricans to check and report electricity, water, and internet outages in real time. The platform solves the problem of unreliable utility information by leveraging crowdsourced data to provide accurate, up-to-date information through an intuitive map-based or list-based interface. It's valuable for residents, businesses, and emergency services who need quick access to outage information, especially in areas with frequent utility disruptions. The web app is optimized for mobile use, ensuring accessibility, speed, and reliability even in low-bandwidth conditions.

# Core Features  

## Map-Based Outage Visualization

- **What it does**: Displays real-time outages on an interactive map of Costa Rica with color-coded markers and filtering capabilities
- **Why it's important**: Provides immediate visual understanding of outage situations across different geographic areas
- **How it works**: Uses OpenStreetMap as base layer with custom markers for different outage types and statuses, supports zooming by province/canton

## List-Based Outage View  

- **What it does**: Alternative interface showing outages in a searchable, sortable list format
- **Why it's important**: Ensures accessibility for users with limited map interaction capabilities or those preferring tabular data
- **How it works**: Displays outage data in table format with sorting by location, time, type, and status

## Anonymous Outage Reporting

- **What it does**: Allows users to submit outage reports without requiring account creation
- **Why it's important**: Lowers barrier to contribution, increasing data volume and platform usefulness
- **How it works**: Simple form with mandatory fields (location, type, description), optional photo upload, GPS coordinates capture with explicit consent

## Real-Time Notifications

- **What it does**: Sends optional browser push notifications for new outages in user-selected areas
- **Why it's important**: Keeps users informed about relevant outages without requiring active platform monitoring
- **How it works**: Browser-based push notification system with user-defined geographic preferences

## Community Validation System

- **What it does**: Enables users to upvote/downvote reports to validate accuracy
- **Why it's important**: Improves data reliability through community consensus and helps identify false reports
- **How it works**: Voting mechanism on each report with automated flagging of suspicious activity

# User Experience  

## User Personas

- **Primary Persona**: Costa Rican resident (18-65, Spanish-speaking) experiencing frequent utility outages, needs quick information and simple reporting process

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### Risk: Complex Geospatial Data Performance

- **Mitigation**: Use simplified GeoJSON shapes, implement server-side clustering, add proper database indexing, and consider tile-based rendering for large datasets

### Risk: Real-time Data Synchronization

- **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic UI updates, add conflict resolution strategies, use Supabase Realtime with proper error handling, and create fallback mechanisms

### Risk: Mobile Performance on Low-End Devices

- **Mitigation**: Implement code splitting, use lightweight map libraries, add progressive loading, create text-only mode, and optimize image assets

## MVP Definition Challenges

### Risk: Scope Creep in MVP

- **Mitigation**: Strict focus on Guanacaste Province only, limit to electricity/water outages, implement basic active/resolved status, and defer advanced features to Phase 2

### Risk: Over-Engineering Initial Solution

- **Mitigation**: Use existing Supabase features instead of custom backend, leverage OpenStreetMap instead of custom mapping solution, implement simple UI first, and add complexity incrementally

### Risk: Data Quality and Validation

- **Mitigation**: Implement CAPTCHA and voting system from start, add automated duplicate detection, create clear data validation rules, and plan for manual moderation oversight

## Resource Constraints

### Risk: Limited Development Team

- **Mitigation**: Prioritize features that deliver maximum user value, use no-code/low-code solutions where possible (Supabase), focus on automation, and implement comprehensive testing

### Risk: Third-Party Service Limitations

- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms for external APIs, design for service degradation, monitor usage limits, and have alternative providers ready

### Risk: Geographic Data Availability

- **Mitigation**: Source boundary data from multiple reliable sources, implement data validation scripts, create manual override capabilities, and plan for community data correction

## User Adoption Risks

### Risk: Low Initial User Engagement

- **Mitigation**: Pre-populate with realistic demo data, implement easy sharing features, target specific communities in Guanacaste, and create incentive mechanisms for early adopters

### Risk: Data Accuracy Concerns

- **Mitigation**: Implement clear data accuracy disclaimers, add verification systems, create user education materials, and build trust through transparency

# Appendix  

## Research Findings

### Costa Rican Utility Landscape

- ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad) dominates electricity sector
- AyA (Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados) handles water services
- Private internet providers include ICE, Claro, Movistar, and smaller regional providers
- Outage patterns vary by region with coastal areas experiencing more weather-related disruptions

### Geographic Data Sources

- OpenStreetMap provides comprehensive boundary data for Costa Rica
- GeoJSON files available through various open data repositories
- Costa Rican government publishes official boundary data through IGN (Instituto GeogrÃ¡fico Nacional)
- Performance optimization requires simplification of complex boundary shapes

### Competitive Analysis

- No comprehensive, real-time outage tracking platform currently exists for Costa Rica
- Utility providers offer limited outage information through their own channels
- Social media serves as primary source for outage information currently
- Opportunity exists to become the authoritative source for outage information
